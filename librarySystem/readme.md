This is a library system I made for a class. It has patrons and books interacting through a checkout system. 
The user has the ability to:add and remove patrons and books, show specific patrons and books with attributes, and check in and out books
  
The project can definitly be expanded on by adding new aspects to patrons and books like years of loyalty or book conition.
