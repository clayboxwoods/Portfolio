This project was done by a group of 6, me included. We were tasked with creating a website sutable for a roofing company. The website was ment to be a tool to take over the companys paper work. the website is fully functioning with its own server and database. The website has a simi-secure sign in system set up. There are different employee accounts and permissions allowing the employee to request time off and manage their accounts. The employees can create contracting leads and edit them when needed. At the websites home page there is a calender that shows all time off requests and contracts for the given day. 
There is a lot for the website moving forward. It can be modified to look more professional. There can be more functionallity to the website when dealing with the contracts. Needs more information from the company to move forward in sertain areas.
