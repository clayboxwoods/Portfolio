encryption cipher

This is an encryption system that i similar to an AES system. The user enters the file to read in the plain text, read in the key, and an ouput file. the plain text goes through pre-processing, substitution, padding, shift rows, parity bit, and mix columns. 

Things to improve the program would be to implament a decryption system. The encryption could use more confusion and defusion to make it more efficient. Over all neatness of the program could be improved for myself and others.
